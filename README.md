# cmp-perf-metrics-doc
This repository contains \(draft\) documentaiton on the processs for calculating roadway performance metrics
for the Congestion Management Process \(CMP\). It is organized as follows:

* This __Introduction__ describes how this documentation repository is organized.
* The __Historical\_Context__ chapter gives historical background on the process of calculating CMP performance metrics.
* The __Defintion\_of\_Metrics__ chapter documents the mathematical defintion of the CMP performance metrics we calculate.
* The __Data\_Sources__ chapter documents the data sources used to calculate the CMP performance metrics.
* The __Data\_Fetch\_Process__ chapter documents how the raw data used to calculate the CMP performance metrics is obtained.
* The __Data\_Preparation__ chapter documents how the raw data must be prepared before the actual process of calulating performance metrics can begin.
* The __Calculation\_of\_Metrics__ chapter documents how the CMP performance metrics are calculated.
* The __Odds\_and\_Ends__ chapter is a place to record important information about this process that doesn't have a "home" in any of the other chapters.

The following diagrams summarize the process used for the 2019 Arterial CMP, and which we plan to use going forward:
* [images/data_fetch_and_prep.svg](./images/data_fetch_and_prep.svg) - summarizes the data "fetch" and "prep" processes 
* [images/calculation_of_metrics_overview.svg](./images/calculation_of_metrics_overview.svg) - summarizes the calculation of metrics, _per se_
